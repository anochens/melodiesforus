		<strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong>&nbsp; We aim to study music purchasing behaviors.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Procedures to be followed:</strong>&nbsp; To complete this study, you will be given $1.50 with which you purchase a <b>single</b> song from a music store. In the store, you may sample the songs. Any money that you do not spend during the course of the study will be paid to you as a bonus payment (see below). This study will also involve filling in a survey questionnaire.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Duration/Time:</strong> The whole process should take you about 10-15 minutes on average.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Statement of Confidentiality:</strong> Your participation in this research is confidential. In the event of a publication or presentation resulting from the research, no personally identifiable information will be shared.</li>

	<strong>Payment for participation:</strong>
